# dedupe-node-modules

Point me at a folder containing a node project and all duplicated depdendcies in `node_modules` will be removed.

## Usage

```bash
$ dedupe-node-modules path/to/project
```

###Â Doesn't npm/yarn do this already?

They are supposed to, yes, but I keep seeing needless duplicates in `node_modules` so something funny is going on.
